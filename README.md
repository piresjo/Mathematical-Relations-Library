# Mathematical-Relations-Library
A small library of functions to create and analyze basic mathematical relations. 

As of August 2016, you can:
- Create certain types of relations with relative ease
- Check to see what type of relation an input relation is 
- Calculate total number of relations
- Perform closures on relations

Things that need to be done in the future:
- Graphical representations of relations
- Add more types of relations to BasicRelations.py
